'pyData' is authored by Gavin Guinn. This program reads through the output files produced by py3Simple, 
compiles counts of numbers with k aliquot parents and outputs all the info to stdout.

     Compliling and Running pyData:
        -Dependacy: https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig
        -pyData has only been tested on unbuntu but should be fine for *nix
        -The makefile should be sufficient for compilation. Just call 'make' without any args.
        -running ./pyData should work as long as py3Simple has already produced output. No args needed all info 
         comes from the config file saved with the data
