This repo contains my project in computational number-\/theory, studying \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sequence}{\texttt{ aliquot sequences}} and properties of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function}{\texttt{ sum-\/of-\/proper-\/divisors}} function. The following problem statement from the former \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_K._Guy}{\texttt{ Dr. Richard Guy}} motivates this work\+:

Think of a number!! Say 36\%, which is nice and divisible. It appears that about 36\% of the even numbers are ”orphans”.

Divide by 1. For about 36\% of the (even) values of n there is just one positive integer m such that s(m) = n. These values of n have just one ”parent”.

Divide by 2. About 18\% of the even values of n have exactly two parents.

Divide by 3. About 6\% of the even values of n have three parents.

Divide by 4. About 1.\+5\% of the even values of n have just 4 parents.

This suggests that 1/(e ·p!) of the even numbers have p parents. Experiments suggests that these values are a bit large for small values of p and a bit small for larger values of p.

Can anything be proved? \end{quote}


{\bfseries{Definition\+:}} n is a k-\/parent aliquot number if {\itshape s$^\wedge$\{-\/1\}(n)} has k solutions.

This repo contains several project, most related to sieve the sum-\/of-\/proper divisors function. More details can be found in detailed src documentation. P\+DF\textquotesingle{}s are my writings on the subject of k-\/parent aliquot numbers.

pomyang\+\_\+kparent counts the occurrence of k-\/parent numbers, by far the most developed. additive\+\_\+sieve is a sum-\/of-\/proper divisors sieve of my own development. huer\+\_\+model computes a model for density of kparent numbers. plot\+\_\+aliquot\+\_\+families is a experiment in plotting aliquot families.
