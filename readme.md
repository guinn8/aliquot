Documentation can be found [here](https://guinn8.github.io/aliquot/html/index.html) or `docs/index.html`

This repo contains several project, most related to sieve the sum-of-proper divisors function. More details can be found in detailed src documentation. PDF's are my writings on the subject of k-parent aliquot numbers.

pomyang_kparent counts the occurrence of k-parent numbers, by far the most developed.
additive_sieve is a sum-of-proper divisors sieve of my own development.
huer_model computes a model for density of kparent numbers.
plot_aliquot_families is a experiment in plotting aliquot families.
